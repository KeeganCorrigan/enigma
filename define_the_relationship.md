# DTR: Define the Relationship

Use this template to when conducting DTR with your project partners. It's recommended that you copy/paste this template into your own gist each time you conduct a DTR to take notes on the conversation.

### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

* What are your learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?

Tristan - Wants to improve understanding of encryption, decryption, and key generation.

Keegan - Wants to improve Ruby writing skills and work on becoming more comfortable with interactions between classes.

* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?

Tristan - Wants to have a consistent pull schedule to minimize merge conflicts. Enjoys pairing (driver - navigator, and ping pong).

Keegan - Doesn't have a strong opinion because he hasn't done it yet.

* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?

Tristan - Kindness! Prefer cogent communication. Enjoys humor and friendships. Directness is preferred, but communicate it in a reasonable way. Less heavy handed.

Keegan - Fairly direct and to the point. Tend to focus on objectives and not people. Can be misinterpreted as being aloof, but he really does care. Prefers direct, actionable, specific feedback.

* How would you describe your work style?

Tristan - Front load a lot of the work. Can get hyper focused when trying to solve something specific.

Keegan - Tends to write the problem down step by step. Diligent to a fault.

* What are your strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?

Tristan - Very flexible. Open to viewpoints, not stubborn. Willing to try other's solutions in most cases.

Keegan - Reliable. Good high level view of projects. Experienced with diverse working groups. Organized.

* Whatâ€™s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?

Tristan - Made a git mistake, but grew as a person. Doesn't always break a problem down into the small steps. Established special bonds with previous partners. Has always achieved a pretty high level of understanding with partners, especially as far as duties and goals are concerned. Needs to improve programming jargon.

Keegan - Doesn't always break problems down into smallest parts. Can have higher expectations than are appropriate. Produces high quality content and work. Wants elegant solutions but lacks the tools to produce them sometimes.

* How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?

Creating a timeline. Setting goals and following through. Time box appropriately. Decision making will be a joint collaborative and compassionate process.

* How will we overcome obstacles?

Achieve a deeper understanding of what the obstacle is. Step away occasionally to recalibrate and approach the problem from a new and fresh angle.

* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?

Tristan - Needs quiet work spaces with few people.

Keegan - Prefers quiet work spaces as well. Frequent communication is useful for solving problems.

* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?

Tristan - Has to catch a bus! Can be here very early.

Keegan - No scheduling restraints.

* What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?

Tristan - Can be too nice. Enjoys giving praise (as long as it's worth giving).

Keegan - Gives praise where appropriate. Appreciates the efforts of others. Direct and honest.

* What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?

Tristan - Has a pretty good dictionary of methods and resources to find further information. Needs to work on recursion.

Keegan - Fairly proficient tester, which helps to break problems down. Need to work on class interactions.

Bolster each other's TDD.

* What tools do you want to use to manage the project?

Slack. Github. Maybe Trello? That seems a bit excessive with two people though.

* How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?

Face to face meetings to discuss the issues and come up with solutions. Figure out if this feature is necessary or important enough to create/fix.

* How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?

We know exactly what every line of code does, and apply some principles of that in the future. A functional product that is well tested.

* How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?

With food. And thank you's!
